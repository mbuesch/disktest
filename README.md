Disktest is a tool to check Solid State Disks, Non-Volatile Memory Storage, Hard Disks, USB sticks, SD cards or other storage media for errors.

It does so by writing a pseudo-random sequence to the device and then reading it back and verifying it against the same pseudo-random sequence.

This tool can be used to:

- Check disks for hardware errors (e.g. platter errors, flash errors, etc.).
- Overwrite storage media with a cryptographically-strong pseudo-random stream. This can either be used to delete existing data on the disk, or to prepare the disk for encryption.
- Test for tampered media that pretend to have more storage area than they physically have. Sometimes such media are sold by fraudulent sellers at cheap prices.
- Measure read and write speed.
- ... probably lots of other tasks.

The pseudo-random number stream is generated by the following algorithm:

```
OUTPUT_DATA := CHACHA20(PBKDF2(SEED | THREAD_ID | ROUND_ID))
```

If more than one thread is used, then each thread generates such a stream, and the streams are interleaved in an alternating pattern.


# Security

The default algorithm [ChaCha20](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salsa20) is a cryptographically strong random number generator. That means if the seed is kept secret, the pseudo-random sequence cannot be predicted or reconstructed by anybody else.

See option `--seed` under `--help` for more details.


# Linux example

The following disktest invocation will write a secure sequence to the disk device `/dev/sdc` and subsequently read back and verify the sequence.

```sh
disktest --write --verify -j0 /dev/sdc
```

For NVMe:

```sh
disktest --write --verify -j0 /dev/nvme0n1
```

For SD / MMC:

```sh
disktest --write --verify -j0 /dev/mmcblk0
```

*WARNING*: This will irrevocably overwrite all data on the storage device! Be absolutely certain that the device path is correct before starting the command. Your data will not be recoverable.

You probably need `root` permissions to write to raw disk devices (`/dev/sdX`, `/dev/nvmeXn1` or `/dev/mmcblkX`).

The target `device` does not have to be an actual hardware device node. It can be any file path on any file system. For example you can mount an USB stick file system and write to a file on that file system. However, please note that this leaves a couple of minor untested spots in the USB stick's memory, which are reserved for the file system. Also see the `Windows` section below.


# Windows example

On Windows disktest can write to any file on any mounted storage media or raw disks.

If your storage media under test is drive E, then the following command would write a test file on drive E and verify it:

```sh
disktest --write --verify -j0 E:\testfile.img
```

But note that testing on the filesystem level, as shown above, does not test the full device.
It will omit the disk areas that the filesystem uses internally.
Therefore, you may want to write to the raw disk E using the Windows raw drive notation, as follows:

```sh
disktest --write --verify -j0 \\.\E:
```

or

```sh
disktest --write --verify -j0 \\.\PhysicalDrive2
```

Doing so will completely wipe all data (including the filesystem) on this disk.

Always make sure that you selected the correct drive.
Especially in the `\\\\.\PhysicalDriveX` notation, it is extremely easy to overwrite the wrong drive by accident.
Therefore, the `\\\\.\X:` (where X is the drive letter) notation is preferred.

# Disktest command line options

Please run either of the following commands to show more information about the available command-line options.

```sh

# Speed

The following table shows some example speed measurements of disktest in various operation modes on different hardware.

These speed tests don't write to an actual disk, but only to the `/dev/null` device, which is a device that does nothing. So these speed test results do not include the speed limits of any physical disk hardware.

The read data rates are similar because the algorithm used is exactly the same.
